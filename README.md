### easyAnnotate
easyAnnotate is a simple HTML5 video annotation solution, written primarily in JavaScript (with a 'lil CSS and HTML thrown in for good measure). 

**Winner of the March 2015 iParadigms Newcastle TurnItIn Hackathon.**

It works basically, and provides text and image annotations. There's probably a few bugs though.

*Please edit the index-dev.html file, rather than index.html - index.html is a production ready file that is destroyed and re-created (from the current contents of index-dev.html) every time the build.py script is ran.*
